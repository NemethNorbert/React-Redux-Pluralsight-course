# About the project

**The project is still in development, this is the point where the course from pluralsight(https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/react-redux-react-router-es6/table-of-contents) took me. I am planning to implement a delete function for Authors and Courses, as well as some nice to have features like sorting to A-Z etc. I`ll keep the project uptodate.
Huge thanks for Cory House who put together a great course!**

**Navigate to the master directory, install node.js 6, then type $npm install to install the node packages. Use $npm run build -s  in the command line to build the production version, or $npm run start -s to start it in developer mode.**
